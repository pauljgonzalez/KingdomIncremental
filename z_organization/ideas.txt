Certainly! If you are creating a game that starts in the medieval period and progresses through subsequent stages of human civilization, hereâ€™s a suggested list of stages in chronological order:

Wood Cutting
Cut wood to upgrade village building and make new/more buildings
Progression could be
Basic Axe - upgrade these through black smith with ores from mining
After upgrading village you can get two man saws that speed it up more
Then more advanced later but that will take time (Industrial revolution)

Mining
Pickaxes at first to get ores. The more you mine the further down the mine goes and the more ores unlock
can stay at certain location to get more of a certain type of ores
Gem eventually but further down. Will hit a block that industiral revolution will need to be unloicked to get explosives
Fire-Setting: Ancient civilizations used fire-setting, where fires were lit against rock faces and then 
quenched with water to fracture the rock, making it easier to extract ores. Could be an intresting 

Leatherworking
Used wood and hide from animals to make tools and supplies for village
Also makes bows, maybe arrows as well unless i want a fletcher 
Leather armor as well. Maybe some armor can help in certain professions
Just basic crafting recipes

Blacksmith
Use items mined from mining to make basic metal tools
